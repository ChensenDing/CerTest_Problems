Example 2D problem with synthetic data. Considers displacement of a cantilevered Euler-Bernoulli beam, with rectangular cross section, and a point load at a tip. This model has been parametrised as a function of an x coordinate (length-wise direction) and the depth of the cross section, thereby lending itself to making 1D/2D plots for the purpose of demonstrating the calibration/emulator codes.
